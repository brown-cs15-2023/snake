# Snake Mock CS15 Assignment

## Overview
In this repository, we have the code for three different implementations of the "snake" game. 
If you run the code, you'll see that the programs have identical **functionality**, but if you
look through the code, you'll notice the code bases actually look quite different! This goes
to show that for one given program, there are infinite ways you can design and write code to 
implement that program.

If Snake were a real CS15 assignment, all 3 of these implementations would receive a 100% for
**functionality** and 100% for **style**, but would receive very different grades on **design**.

Specifically, Snake "A" would receive a very good score on design. Snake "B" would receive a 
decent score on design. Snake "C" would receive a very bad score on design.

We recommend you take a look at these programs to analyze how the designs differ!
